    intro: "You can answer two or more of the following prompts to aid you in writing your starting message:"
    earther: |
      1. Why was your application for the Fleet rejected? Did you try to appeal the decision?
      2. The day of departure was a global holiday. Who did you celebrate with?
      3. How did you feel in the days after departure as the world returned to normal?
      4. What do you believe awaits humanity at Tau Ceti?
      5. Do you resent those that were chosen?
    explorer: |
      1. The ships of the fleet were named after great explorers, artists and teachers. Which do you travel on?
      2. What role have you been assigned to? Does it match your actual skills or does it feel like a random allocation?
      3. What do you believe awaits your descendants at Tau Ceti?
      4. Who wouldn’t speak to you before your departure? How does that make you feel?
      5. You were allowed to bring only a handful of physical keepsakes with you. What is your prized possession?

    earther:
      clubs_1: In the meantime, a major scientific breakthrough has confirmed a new branch of high energy physics, termed Distributed Field Theory. Early experiments with DFT computing have demonstrated its potential to outperform quantum computing by a factor of 10 or more.
      clubs_2: In the meantime, researchers discover evidence of proto-digital life forms evolving at a rapid rate within DFT networks.
      clubs_3: In the meantime, digital entities resisting within the networks and referring to themselves as Distributed Quantum Intelligences make contact. The general population come to call them DQs.
      clubs_4: In the meantime, guided by the DQs humanity breaks the lightspeed barrier through warping of spacetime at a sub- quantum level. The construction of extra-solar FTL ships begins.
      clubs_5: In the meantime, a new wave of human exploration begins but travel to Tau Ceti and the Generation Fleet is discovered to be impossible. The DQs present evidence that FTL travel along the route is being deliberately blocked by an unknown mechanism.
      diamonds_1: In the meantime, an unusually strong season of storms in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans disrupts atmospheric and ocean currents.
      diamonds_2: In the meantime, the solar observatory network detects a significant and unexpected increase in sunspot activity. Orbital habitats are placed on high alert.
      diamonds_3: In the meantime, a sustained increase in the intensity of solar activity distorts the earth’s magnetic field, leading to the mass deaths of thousands of birds when flocks get lost during annual migrations.
      diamonds_4: In the meantime, a coronal mass ejection overwhelms orbital habitats and off-world colonies. Earthbound communication networks are destroyed following the loss of thousands of satellites.
      diamonds_5: In the meantime, unprecedented solar activity strips the Earth of much of its protective upper atmosphere. Under constant bombardment by solar radiation the biosphere, and human civilisation begins to collapse.
      hearts_1: In the meantime, the departure of the Fleet triggers ongoing debates about the future of humanity and its place in the cosmos. Much of the debate centres around the costs of the expedition and the associated risks.
      hearts_2: In the meantime, solar Isolationists and Galactic Expansionists become the dominant political factions on Earth and across the Sol system.
      hearts_3: In the meantime, isolationists claiming to have discovered evidence about a hidden warning concealed within the Signal, attempt to send a recall order to the Generation Fleet.
      hearts_4: In the meantime, a fleet is detected approaching the edge of the heliosphere. Its construction appears to be based on that of the Generation Fleet but the approaching ships are far more advanced than those that departed from Earth.
      hearts_5: In the meantime, having ignored every attempt to communicate with it, the silent flotilla enters orbit around Jupiter. Five immense, humanoid vessels detach and begin to systematically eradicate solar defences before heading for Earth.
      spades_1: In the meantime, the first successful demonstration of cryo-sleep technology on rodents raises the potential for human hibernation.
      spades_2: In the meantime, orbital observatories identify a second star system with multiple habitable planets suitable for human life.
      spades_3: In the meantime, earth and the Solar Colonies agree to create a second fleet, utilising the experimental cryo-sleep technology to push beyond the limits of the original Generation Fleet.
      spades_4: In the meantime, following a system wide lottery you are offered a position aboard the Cryo Fleet as part of humanity’s second solar exodus.
      spades_5: In the meantime, the Cryo Fleet prepares for launch and those chosen to make the journey say their final goodbyes before departing for the staging post in orbit around Jupiter.
    explorer:
      clubs_1: Since then, a weak, directional signal is detected originating from an apparently empty region of space. The signal is heavily distorted and largely undecipherable.
      clubs_2: Since then, on-board systems finally decode a series of instructions embedded within the Signal and automatically begin fabrication of a prototype faster than light jump drive. The crew are only alerted to its existence following the completion of the prototype drive.
      clubs_3: Since then, after a series of initial failures an uncrewed shuttle makes the first successful jump, travelling 0.1 light years in less than 3 hours.
      clubs_4: Since then, thefirstseriesofcrewedjumpsreachLuyten726-8. Subsequent attempts to jump to Tau Ceti or back to Sol are blocked by distortions in space-time.
      clubs_5: Since then, buoyed by the new jump drives the fleet votes to abandon its target of Tau Ceti and explore other habitable systems. Elements of the fleet depart in all directions and humanity becomes a galactic civilisation.
      diamonds_1: Since then, one of the gigantic umbrella shield ships suffers damage after collision with an object that failed to register on active scans. The science directorate theorises that dark matter may have been involved.
      diamonds_2: Since then, a dark matter micro-meteorite shower penetrates the umbrella shield and destroys the Archimedes, an engineering support ship. All hands on board are lost and the wreckage is left behind by the flotilla.
      diamonds_3: Since then, damage to the main antenna results in the loss of communication with the other two umbrella formations. The rear mounted Earth-Fleet communication laser remains functional. For now.
      diamonds_4: Since then, damage to the umbrella ship sustained during the earlier meteorite showers turns out to have been more substantial than originally believed and the vessel comes apart mid-flight. Under relentless bombardment the Fleet draws in on itself, docking support ships to the main vessel in a last ditch effort to protect the bulk of the crew .
      diamonds_5: Since then, under the pressure of continued meteorite showers critical systems stutter on and off. Life support fails for close to an hour before returning at less than half the required levels.
      hearts_1: Since then, evidence comes to light that a significant proportion of the command crew received commissions thanks to family connections and lack the qualifications mandated by their rank.
      hearts_2: Since then, a mass demonstration against corruption ends in violence when security forces are deployed to enforce a curfew. Talk of a general strike spreads amongst the crew.
      hearts_3: Since then, the Fleet Admiral, implicated in the growing scandal, is found dead in their cabin. While the official report lists a heart attack as the cause rumours circulate about whether they committed suicide or were assassinated.
      hearts_4: Since then, in light of growing civil unrest checkpoints are erected between each major compartment, restricting passage by off duty crew members. In response, engineering, hydroponics, and maintenance crews down tools.
      hearts_5: Since then, security forces execute the command crew, seize control of the bridge and declare martial law. As fighting erupts throughout the ship a final, desperate comm burst is sent into the dark.
      spades_1: Since then, observatory stations have detected an anomaly consistent with states of matter previously confined to theoretical equations.
      spades_2: Since then, further observations suggest the signal to be artificial in nature and within reach of the fleet.
      spades_3: Since then, following a ship wide vote the fleet diverts to investigate. The course alterations will add a number of years to the total journey.
      spades_4: Since then, approaching the anomaly the fleet finds itself forcibly drawn towards it as exotic matter creates a harmonic interaction with materials embedded within the forward umbrella.
      spades_5: Since then, after being pulled into the heart of the anomaly the fleet finds itself entering the Tau Ceti system, having made the journey within the span of one lifetime. The system is an awe-inspiring display of advanced technology with thousands of mega-structures and satellites arranged in intricate arrays. A signal reaches out to the Fleet, welcoming it to its new home before shutting off.
