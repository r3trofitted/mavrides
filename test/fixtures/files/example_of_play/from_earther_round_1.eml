Hey, Abelar!

Receiving your message was the highlight of my day. Thank you. I must =
say that I've been feeling a bit down ever since the departure. After =
all the celebrations, going back to the daily life felt strange and =
dream-like, like I was in a comedown. Which might have been the case, to =
be honest =E2=80=93 I have spent the Big Departure Day with William, and =
we did a lot of the stuff he always carries around! It was strange to =
feel so happy and high while knowing, in the back of my head, that I'll =
never see you again. I was happy and excited with you, and yet I'll =
never be with you again.

But I don't want to ruin your day with my sad thoughts! I'm really happy =
for you, and you really deserved to go, even if they're too stupid to =
realize that you can do better than looking after computers! I wish you =
the best, safest and most wondrous journey!
