This is it. We are off. To Tau Ceti, can you believe it? Even though =
I'll never see what's out there, I know.
But I cannot stop thinking about what my grandchildren will see when =
they get there. Impossibly alien space
stations? Earth-like planets kept green and pure like Eden? How strange =
would it be to them, who would have
never known anything else but life in a spaceship?

Talking about the spaceships, did you know that they've all been named =
after great scientists? Mine is
the Marie Curie, which is ironic since I've been tasked with computer =
maintenance, even though I have
a PhD in experimental physics! But I'm not complaining =E2=80=93 I've =
been lucky to be chosen, after all.

Which makes me think of you. I'm so sorry that you had to stay. For you, =
but for me, too. I miss you already.
