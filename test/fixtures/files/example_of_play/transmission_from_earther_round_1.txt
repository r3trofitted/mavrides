Hey, Abelar!

Receiving your message was the highlight of my day. Thank you. I must say that I've been feeling a bit down
ever since the departure. After all the celebrations, going back to the daily life felt strange and dream-like,
like I was in a comedown. Which might have been the case, to be honest â€“ I have spent the Big Departure Day
with William, and we did a lot of the stuff he always carries around! It was strange to feel so happy and high
while knowing, in the back of my head, that I'll never see you again. I was happy and excited with you, and
yet I'll never be with you again.

But I don't want to ruin your day with my sad thoughts! I'm really happy for you, and you really deserved
to go, even if they're too stupid to realize that you can do better than looking after computers! I wish
you the best, safest and most wondrous journey!

21 days have passed since the departure of the fleet, and it's been 14 days since you last wrote
Philip Constantine.

Since then, observatory stations have detected an anomaly consistent with states of matter previously
confined to theoretical equations.

As for yourself, someone got married! Who was it and what do they mean to you?
