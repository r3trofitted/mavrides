This is it. We are off. To Tau Ceti, can you believe it? Even though I'll never see what's out there, I know.
But I cannot stop thinking about what my grandchildren will see when they get there. Impossibly alien space
stations? Earth-like planets kept green and pure like Eden? How strange would it be to them, who would have
never known anything else but life in a spaceship?

Talking about the spaceships, did you know that they've all been named after great scientists? Mine is
the Marie Curie, which is ironic since I've been tasked with computer maintenance, even though I have
a PhD in experimental physics! But I'm not complaining â€“ I've been lucky to be chosen, after all.

Which makes me think of you. I'm so sorry that you had to stay. For you, but for me, too. I miss you already.
