Abelar,

You don't know it, but your messages take a long time to reach me, and even more for me
to process them. I thought that I would eventually overcome my regrets of not leaving
Earth with you, but I simply cannot. You would like me to find someone and marry them?
How could I when my thoughts are always beyond the stratosphere, or rather in their
own, lightless void. I'm losing grip on really, and to the point that things are
getting difficult for me at work, and I need to rectify this. So I need to stop thinking
about you. And so, to stop having these conversations with you.

I'm sorry. Please don't reply. Safe travels.

[Connection lost]

Your connection with Philip Constantine has faded to the point that they no longer
feel the drive to maintain it with you. Maybe you feel the same?

This is the end of the game. Feel free to reach out to Vincent O. to debrief and
discuss the feelings that it invoked.

Thanks for playing!
