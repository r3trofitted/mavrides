Abelar,

You don't know it, but your messages take a long time to reach me, and even=
 more for me to process them. I thought that I would eventually overcome my=
 regrets of not leaving Earth with you, but I simply cannot. You would like=
 me to find someone and marry them? How could I when my thoughts are always=
 beyond the stratosphere, or rather in their own, lightless void. I'm losin=
g grip on really, and to the point that things are getting difficult for me=
 at work, and I need to rectify this. So I need to stop thinking about you.=
 And so, to stop having these conversations with you.

I'm sorry. Please don't reply. Safe travels.
