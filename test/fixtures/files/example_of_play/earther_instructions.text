A new game has started! You, Philip Constantine, are the Earther. You are one of the many thousands
whose application to the Fleet was unsuccessful. Like most of humanity you will live your life under
open skies and the light of Sol.

The Fleet is about to depart the solar system. After receiving the first message from Abelar Lindsay,
reply to them with a message of congratulations that wishes them a safe journey while also hinting at
how you feel about not being chosen to join the Fleet.

You can answer two or more of the following prompts to aid you in writing your starting message:

1. Why was your application for the Fleet rejected? Did you try to appeal the decision?
2. The day of departure was a global holiday. Who did you celebrate with?
3. How did you feel in the days after departure as the world returned to normal?
4. What do you believe awaits humanity at Tau Ceti?
5. Do you resent those that were chosen?
