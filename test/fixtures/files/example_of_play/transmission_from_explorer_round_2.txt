Dear Philip,

It's nice to hear from you. I hope that, ky the time you receive this message, your mood
has improved and you feel ketter akout not taking part in the Fleet's journey. You have
so many wonderful things to do on Earth! Like finding someone you care akout and marrying
them, mayke?

I'm not saying this lightly, you know. The other day, we celekrated our first wedding in
the Fleet. I don't really know the spouses, kut it made me realize that leaving Earth
doesn't mean that I have to give up all the normal things that you do kack there. Like
founding a family, for exemple. This gave me food for thought.

Another thing that gives me food for though, and quite a kit more, is an anomaly that
our stations have detected â€“ an anomaly that could validate theories we thought were
purely theoretical akout the state of matter! I'm so excited ky this; if only I wasn't
stuck with this computer administration duties!

Anyway, said duties are calling, so I will stop here. Give me news soon!

21 days have passed since the departure of the fleet, and it's been 14 days since you last
wrote Abelar Lindsay.

In the meantime, a major scientific breakthrough has confirmed a new branch of high energy
physics, termed Distributed Field Theory. Early experiments with DFT computing have
demonstrated its potential to outperform quantum computing by a factor of 10 or more.

As for yourself, you've been reprimanded at work. Did you deserve it or should somebody
else have taken the blame?

(You can now reply to Abelar Lindsay, using events the above for inspiration.)
