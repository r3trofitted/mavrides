Dear Philip,

It's nice to hear from you. I hope that, by the time you receive this messa=
ge, your mood has improved and you feel better about not taking part in the=
 Fleet's journey. You have so many wonderful things to do on Earth! Like fi=
nding someone you care about and marrying them, maybe?

I'm not saying this lightly, you know. The other day, we celebrated our fir=
st wedding in the Fleet. I don't really know the spouses, but it made me re=
alize that leaving Earth doesn't mean that I have to give up all the normal=
 things that you do back there. Like founding a family, for exemple. This g=
ave me food for thought.

Another thing that gives me food for though, and quite a bit more, is an an=
omaly that our stations have detected =E2=80=93 an anomaly that could valid=
ate theories we thought were purely theoretical about the state of matter! =
I'm so excited by this; if only I wasn't stuck with this computer administr=
ation duties!

Anyway, said duties are calling, so I will stop here. Give me news soon!
