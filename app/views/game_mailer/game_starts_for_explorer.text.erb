A new game has started! You, <%= @game.explorer_name %>, are the Explorer. You are one of the few, selected to represent humanity 
on its maiden voyage to the stars. Though you will never know your distant destination, it is a prestigious 
assignment made all the harder by the knowledge that you will never again see your friends or family or 
the sun and sky.

The Fleet as just crossed the heliopause, the boundary between the edge of the solar system and interstellar 
space. Send your starting message to <%= @game.earther_name %> that lets them know how much you will miss them 
and how excited you are about the journey that lies ahead of you.

You can answer two or more of the following prompts to help you write your starting message:

1. The ships of the fleet were named after great explorers, artists and teachers. Which do you travel on?
2. What role have you been assigned to ? Does it match your actual skills or does it feel like a random allocation?
3. What do you believe awaits your descendants at Tau Ceti?
4. Who wouldnâ€™t speak to you before your departure? How does that make you feel?
5. You were allowed to bring only a handful of physical keepsakes with you. What is your prized possession?
